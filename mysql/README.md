# rump-mysql

*Experimental work in progress.* Please report success, failure or anything
else to the Rump Kernel mailing list or IRC:
http://wiki.rumpkernel.org/Info:-Community

Unmodified MySQL, plus supporting infrastructure for running it as a Unikernel
on Xen using [rumprun](http://repo.rumpkernel.org/rumprun).

Building requires a working installation of rumprun, and NetBSD makefs
(the version available as makefs on Debian-based distributions works fine).
