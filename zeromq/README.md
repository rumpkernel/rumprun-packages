# Overview

This is zeromq 4.2.1 for Rumprun. The test platform is running Ubuntu 16.04 and the compilation options include ```-std=c++17```.

## Instructions
Use the included``Makefile`` by typing ```make```.

## Examples

In order to run an example application on rumprun, you have to provide the paths to the ```zmq.h``` header file and the ```libzmq``` library during compilation: 

```
$ x86_64-rumprun-netbsd-gcc <filename>  -I <path-to-zeromq-package>/include \
-L <path-to-zeromq-package>/lib -lpthread -lzmq -o <filename-output>
```
Example (testing):
```
<path-to-zeromq-package>/lib = /root/git/rumprun-packages/pkgs/lib
<path-to-zeromq-package>/include = /root/git/rumprun-packages/pkgs/include

x86_64-rumprun-netbsd-g++ -std=c++17 example1.cpp  -I/root/git/rumprun-packages/pkgs/include -L/root/git/rumprun-packages/pkgs/lib -lpthread -lzmq -o example1-rr

rumprun-bake hw_generic example1-rr.bin example1-rr

rumprun qemu -i example1-rr.bin
```
All other steps (baking, running) remain the same.

### Example 1
A simple one-way zeromq messaging using ZMQ_REQ and ZMQ_REP. 

### Example 2
A simple one-way zeromq messaging using ZMQ_DEALER (asynchronos). 


## Benchmark
The rumprun xen benchmark is against docker and rumprun qemu. All the tests are performed in Virtualbox by simply running the ```exemple1``` 10 times. Note that the goal here is to have a first performance trend, and not to globally evaluate rumprun performance.

### Benchmark 1
The first test's Dockerfile requires the ```example1``` executable compiled and built as
```
g++ -std=c++17 example1.cpp -lpthread -lzmq -o example1
```
The Dockerfile is attached.

The first figure shows the difference in performance of rumprun qemu and rumprun xen.

The second figure says that rumprun xen performs, at least, more than five times faster than docker.
