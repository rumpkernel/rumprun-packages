LuaJIT
======

[LuaJIT](http://luajit.org/) is a Just-In-Time Compiler (JIT) for the Lua programming language. Lua is a powerful, dynamic and light-weight programming language. It may be embedded or used as a general-purpose, stand-alone language.

Overview
--------

This document explains how to obtain a LuaJIT interpreter for Rumprun. The LuaJIT interpreter built by the Makefile is `2.0.4`. 
At this time, I see this LuaJIT package being used as an embedded language library.
